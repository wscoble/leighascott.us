As the sun rising begins a new day, we thought the metaphor fit well for us
starting our new lives together.

Here's the tenative plan.

A small wedding with about 2 dozen guests including 4 bridesmaids and 4 groomsmen,
located somewhere in Las Vegas, outdoors, where the sun can rise in the background as
we say our vows. We will have breakfast and drinks for the reception, which may
end between 10am and noon.

Sunrise on the dates in the [date poll](/post/date-poll/) is between 6:20am and
6:30am. Please vote for a date if you haven't yet.
